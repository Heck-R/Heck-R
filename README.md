# Introduction

All there is to know about me is that I like
- ðŸ’» Programming
- ðŸŽ® Playing video games
- ðŸ“º Watching anime

# Languages

Whatever I need. I like to try new things.  \
My familiarity can change around based on what I'm doing.

If I have to choose something for quick and simple stuff, then it's either Python due to the vast selection of libs or the base web stack (HTML & CSS & JS) due to the easy and flexible UI and the fact that it works about everywhere without much effort

# Projects

I make what I need or what seems like fun. That's all.
